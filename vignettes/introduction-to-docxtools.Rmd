A collection of helper functions for designing Word documents used in a classroom or workshop setting. These are particularly useful when my collaborators work with Office software only. 

The package has these functions for formatting numbers and aligning table columns, 

- `align_pander()` 
- `format_engr()` 

and these for putting workspace in a printed document to create space for written responses, 

- `put_axes()` 
- `put_gap()`
