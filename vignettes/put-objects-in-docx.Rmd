Using R, RStudio, R Markdown, and knitr to produce Word documents is a regular part of my workflow when my collaborators are MSOffice users. This package is a collection of helper functions for designing Word documents used in a classroom or workshop setting. 

## overview

The package has these functions for formatting tables, 

- align_pander() 
- format_engr() 

and these for putting specific objects in a document, 

- put_axes() 
- put_gap()
